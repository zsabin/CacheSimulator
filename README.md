# CacheSimulator
Given a specific cache and replacement policy this program will read in a list of addresses. It will then simulate a read of each of these addresses returning a "hit" or a "miss" for each simulated read. This allows the simulator to highlight the differences between replacement policies and organization schemes in cache memory systems.

This simulator supports two replacement policies: least frequently used and least recently used. It also supports various organization schemes by allowing for the customization of the number of sets in the cache, the number of lines in each set, the number of bytes per block and the word size. 

I developed this program for my CSC 322 Systems Programming class in Spring 2016.
